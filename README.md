# StarWarsApp

Welcome to the star wars angular app. 

This app uses ngrx to handle calls from the starwars api [Star Wars](https://swapi.com).

Enhancements

- [ ] Create pages for all 6 resources (only pages / landing and films working)
- [ ] Subscribe to only selected versions of the store
- [ ] Some calls only send back arrays of 10. Create a function to build all results before displaying - possible lazy load or crate a recursive function

Stretch 
- [ ] Click ```li``` tags and make the info bigger and the opening crawl... crawl . Just as it would be awesome.
